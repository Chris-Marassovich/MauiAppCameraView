A simple repo case to demonstrate an error with the CameraView from the CommunityToolkit MAUI.

On both Anroid and iOS I get a "Unable to retreive Handler" exception.

Run up the app and from the App Shell Menu select the Camera menu option and the exception should appear.
You will need to run it up witht eh debugger attached otherwise it's simple an application crash.
